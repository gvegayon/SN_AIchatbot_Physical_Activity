#Consider this later
1. do I need to compare different approach for detecting innovators and adopters (this is the contribution of this study)
2. Do I need to simulate multiple times of diffusion process? (run simulations is to know the benefits of this different approach)
3. The efficacy is not significant, what can I do for this?
4. Do I need to write function for this?
-The number of connections
-The number of being a mediator between two other nodes
-Distance with 

#plot the better approach
1. diffusion network
2. the diffusion process

# the next step
5. consider the day level diffusion
